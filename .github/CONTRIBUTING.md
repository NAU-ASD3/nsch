Thank you for following these guidelines!

## Pull requests

Please avoid pushing commits directly to the main branch.
Instead, please create a new branch, push commits to that branch, then send a Pull Request (PR) to main.
Before merging any PR, there should be one other project member that reviews and approves the proposed changes.

* Documentation should be written directly in man/*.Rd files.
* Any new functionality should have an example and test.
* Increase the version number in NEWS.md and DESCRIPTION.
* Add an item in NEWS.md to describe the changes.
