Thank you for following these guidelines!

## Pull requests

Please avoid pushing commits directly to the main branch.
Instead, please create a new branch, push commits to that branch, then send a minimal Pull Request (PR) to main ([video demonstration](https://vimeo.com/1159760944)).
Before merging any PR, there should be one other project member that reviews and approves the proposed changes.

* Documentation should be written directly in man/*.Rd files.
* Any new functionality should have an example and test.
* Increase the version number in NEWS.md and DESCRIPTION, based on the current date.
* Add an item in NEWS.md to describe the changes.
* Each PR should be minimal, which means there should be one (not multiple) new feature or bug fix, so that the PR is easy to review. Please indicate in the PR title whether the PR is a bugfix, a feature, or a documentation update, etc.
